Introduction
------------
Explore Splunk App allows the user to see where their data is coming from based on the hosts and the amount of data
that's being fed to different indices. It will also show the 10 most popular fields within the selected index and
the number of events/distinct events with those fields.

Dependencies
------------
This app depends on the splunkwftoolkit app, version 1.1 and will run on Splunk 6.x.

Usage
-----
The app will initially populate with hostnames, allowing the user to select multiple hosts to compare to. A Sankey
chart will appear with each host selected, showing the user the sources the data is coming from and the differing
amounts of data being fed to different indices. The ability to select multiple sources and indices depends on the
hosts selected. The Sankey depends only on the hosts, not the sources or indices selected and will not refine itself
if you select multiple sourcetypes or indices. However, the example search string will refine itself with each
selection of the sourcetypes and indices. Clicking on a link on the Sankey will show a table with the top 10 fields
within the selected index, and the number of events/distinct events.
